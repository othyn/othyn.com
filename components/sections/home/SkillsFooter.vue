      Wanna know something <i>neat?</i> This site is running on a homelab
      cluster provisioned with Rancher!<br />There is a load more stuff to
      mention here, but its less skills and more things like; dotfiles,
      environments, homelab and supportive tooling, which are less about skills
      and more about effective/efficient development, getting things just how
      you like them all wrapped up in a GitOps, automatable fashion.
