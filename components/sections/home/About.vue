    <p>Since I could code and tinker with electronics, I have.</p>

    <p>
      Starting with operating system installs to writing my first application in
      Visual Basic at around age 12, I have had an innate passion for all things
      tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my teen years I explored all aspects of computing, developing a
      keen knowledge of everything from power into the machine to user
      interaction. Each aspect of the technical world presented me with a new
      avenue to explore, taking a keen interest in Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then my love of software beganâ€¦ I learnt a wide range of languages,
      fiddled and built a solid knowledge of software design principals and
      participated in the open source community - and still do. I also built
      computers - a lot of them - from budget builds to monster workstations,
      while later discovering virtualisation and home-labbing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next came the beginnings of my early career, starting as an intern in
      software development at the beginning of 2014. Within a short time, I was
      <WidgetsDomfetti>promoted</WidgetsDomfetti> from intern to Web Developer
      then <WidgetsDomfetti>promoted</WidgetsDomfetti> further, into Senior
      Software Developer. I trained, lead and supported the next generation of
      excited Junior Developers, driving my ambition through their passion. I
      lead, managed and developed a rapidly expanding, award-winning product,
      and delivered the best result for both business and stakeholders.

      ><span style="color: #e460ab">T</span> step, I'm now employed as the Lead
      Software Engineer helping to expand, refine and diversify an impactful
      product.
    </p>

    <p>
      Software development is my calling, facilitated by my innate ability to
      quickly consume, understand and distil information to support others. I
      also have a strong sense of self-motivation and passion for high-quality
      software development, always delivering to a progressive personal
      standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I am devoted. I live and breathe any and all things software and
      hardware and am pretty much interested in anything that has a plug socket
      on it; opening it up, tinkering around and seeing how it all works. I love
      the way I can create and let my mind run wild through what is usually a
      rigid and unforgiving electrical world. But I seem to have a knack for it,
      I speak its language.

      P.S. Yeah the commands don't really work on an actual terminal, but its
      all a bit of tongue in cheek fun.
